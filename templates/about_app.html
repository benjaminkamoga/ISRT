            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This tool is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to streamline, enhance, and automate the monitoring, inspection, and analysis of healthcare premises. It consolidates inspection raw data, recall information, disposal activities, and quality assurance metrics into a single interactive dashboard.</p>
            <p>Built with a modern frontend, dynamic tables, charts, modals, and interactive maps, the tool ensures responsiveness, usability, and accessibility across devices. It transforms complex workflows into actionable intelligence for inspectors, supervisors, and QA teams.</p>

            <h2>Key Features & Advantages</h2>
            <h3>1. Daily Inspection Data & Summary Collection via Forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Captures inspection summaries in real-time through dynamic online forms.</li>
                <li>Allows multiple entries per premise category and per product being recalled.</li>
                <li>Aggregates data immediately into the premise database for quick access.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Premise Database & Map Location Tracking</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stores all premise information centrally and links each premise to an interactive map location.</li>
                <li>Map pins show the actual premise location, quick inspection history, and alert/violation intensity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Quick View of Observations Identified per Premise</h3>
            <p>Displays premise-specific cards showing quick inspection summaries and critical issues without navigating raw data.</p>

            <h3>4. Automated Time-Based Summaries & Reports</h3>
            <p>Aggregates inspections, recalls, disposals, and QA activities into period-based summaries for reporting.</p>

            <h3>5. Progressive Achievement Tracking</h3>
            <p>Tracks cumulative inspection coverage and QA performance against targets, highlighting lagging categories.</p>

            <h3>6. QA Tracking (Pass Rates, Sample Counts, Target Achievement)</h3>
            <p>Monitors QA metrics visually for quick understanding and ensures compliance.</p>

            <h3>7. Disposal Tracking</h3>
            <p>Tracks disposal activities by product type, region, and district, integrating them into time-based workflows.</p>

            <h3>8. Risk-Based Summary</h3>
            <p>Determines the risk areas based on accurate data and highlights high-risk districts and low-inspection coverage areas for prioritized follow-up.</p>
